# JavaScript-Quiz

This project, which I namedJavaScript-Quiz, is part of the 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz Challenge for U.C. Berkeley Extension's Coding Boot Camp. My name is Eric Rothmuller and I am a student of the Boot Camp. In this project I was tasked with creating a code quiz that displays a timed quiz of JavaScript questions. When the answer is incorrect, time is taken from the clock. When all questions are answered or the timer is at 0, the game is over. Then the user can save their initials to a high score page.

5. Copy and paste the contents of the "JavaScript-Quiz-main" zip file to your new directory - the one linked to the repository you made.
6. Add the new files within git with: git add .
7. Commit the files within git with: git commit -m "add your comment here"

## Special Note About Missing Items

One item that I was not able to get functioning was the localStorage of user's scores and appending them to the High Scores page. The code I was working on is in the script.js file at the bottom in comments. I am planning on going back and finishing that work in the future but others are more than welcome to take their crack at the code.
